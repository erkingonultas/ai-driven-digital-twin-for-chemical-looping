# AI-Driven Digital Twin for Chemical Looping

## Chemical Looping Simulation and Optimization

## Overview

This implementation will:  
- Simulate a basic chemical looping process using Python.  
- Use machine learning (Bayesian Optimization) to optimize the process.  
- Include safety monitoring using anomaly detection.  

## Key Parameters  

- **Reactor Temperature (T)**  
- **Oxygen Carrier Efficiency (OC)**  
- **Hydrogen Yield (H₂_yield)**  
- **Process Safety Factor (SF)**  

## Objectives  

1. Use **Bayesian Optimization** to maximize H₂ yield while keeping the process safe.  
2. Develop a **Digital Twin Simulation** that predicts process outcomes.  
3. Implement an **Anomaly Detector** to identify hazardous conditions.

## Explanation of the Implementation  

### 1. Simulated Chemical Looping Process  
- Uses **reactor temperature (T)** and **oxygen carrier efficiency (OC)** as inputs.  
- Computes **hydrogen yield (H₂_yield)** using a Gaussian function peaking at 850K.  
- Calculates a **safety factor (SF)**—closer to 0 means safer.  

### 2. Gaussian Process (GP) Regression for Process Prediction  
- Trains a **Gaussian Process (GP) model** using experimental data.  
- Learns the relationship between process parameters and H₂ yield.  

### 3. Bayesian Optimization for Process Tuning  
- Uses **Expected Improvement (EI)** to find the best T and OC for maximum H₂ yield.  
- Ensures **safe operation** by considering the safety factor (SF).  

### 4. Process Safety Integration  
- The optimization prevents hazardous conditions by penalizing unsafe operations.  


This is a simplified version of how AI could optimize and control a chemical looping process. In a real-world application, we would:
1. Use real experimental data.
2. Integrate the digital twin with live sensor feedback.
3. Deploy AI models in an industrial setting.
